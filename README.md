**Population Timelapse of Thessaly – Interactive Web Map**
This repository contains an interactive web-based population timelapse map of the Thessaly region (Greece), developed in the context of an academic project on thematic cartography.

The application visualizes population change over time using animated proportional symbols. 
Population data are displayed for a period of four years, allowing users to explore spatial and temporal population dynamics.

The map includes:
- Population timelapse (1991–2021)
- Proportional symbols with perceptual (Flannery) scaling
- Timeline controls (play/pause and year slider)
- Adjustable symbol size and opacity
- Municipal boundaries
- Multiple basemap options

The map is built with MapLibre GL JS and uses GeoJSON datasets for all spatial layers. 
Users can interactively control the animation and map appearance.

→ Population data are based on the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) for the years: 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021
